"Payment" transaction is when someone make a payment on certain expenses. Whereas for "paydebt" transaction is when someone return an amount of money he/she owed.

** Justification: Since an error transaction is allowed to be deleted if a wrong transaction is made. However, if the person in the transaction does not exist anymore, it implies that the person has already cleared all his/her debt and that transaction is a valid transaction and is not a wrongly added transaction.
Furthermore, a transaction can only be added only if the person in the transaction existed.
